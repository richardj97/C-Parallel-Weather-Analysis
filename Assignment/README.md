# OpenCL Tutorials

## Requirements

The presented tutorials were developed and tested on Windows 10, Visual Studio 2017 and [Intel SDK for OpenCL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-opencl). With some small modifications, however, it should be possible to run the tutorials on different operating systems, programming environments and OpenCL SDKs. Tutorial 2 and 4 both depend on additional libraries (GLUT and Boost.Compute) with installation instructions for Windows presented below.

### Tutorial 2
 - [GLUT](https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/). The core library files together with Windows binaries are provided in the `Graphics` folder.  
 
### Tutorial 4
 - [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) library built with Boost.Compute functionality. The easiest way of setting up the Boost.Compute library at home is to download the pre-built library pack from Blackboard (`Study Materials\Week 1\boost_1_60_0.zip`), extract the files directly to a C drive and rename the folder to “local” so that the boost is located in `c:\local\boost_1_60_0`. It is a large collection of files so extracting might take long time (i.e. 10+ minutes!).
